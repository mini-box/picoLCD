Introduction
-------------

    Usblcd is a small application based on libusblcd aiming to provide
basic functionality for Mini-Box.Com USB LCD.
    Usblcd is a command line client which is able to execute multiple commands 
given on command line.
    Future versions will be able to parse commands from STDIN.

Requirements
------------
    Usblcd doesn't require any kernel drivers except basic USB drivers
    and can run on both 2.4.x and 2.6.x kernel versions.
    
    It relies on libusb (http://libusb.sourceforge.net) and libhid
    (libhid.alioth.debian.org).
    
    Also usbfs filesystem must be mounted (by default on all linux distributions).
    You can mount usbfs by executing the command:
     mount -t usbfs usbfs /proc/bus/usb
    
    To verify if usb is working corectly on your distribution execute:
	lsusb or lsusb -v
    which should list the usb devices that are connected to your computer 
    like in the exemple below
    
    Bus 003 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
    Bus 002 Device 003: ID 04d8:0002 Microchip Technology, Inc.
    Bus 002 Device 002: ID 046d:c01e Logitech, Inc.
    Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
    Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000
    
Using usblcd
-------------

    Running usblcd with the USBLCD connected to a USB port without
any parameters should output:

  device identification of HIDInterface 002/003[0]:
  dev_handle:    0x09304440
  device:        0x09300208
  location:      002/003
  manufacturer:  ACME Labs
  product:       ACME LCD keypad
  serial number: 1.4 beta
  
    The manufacturer, product and serial number might change in the future but
the output should be similar.  
  
    Usblcd accepts multiple commands on command line or from STDIN.
    These commands can be written one after another delimited by space.

Description of commands    
-----------------------

    usblcd backlight [0|1]
	turns on or off LCD screen backlight

    usblcd  contrast [0-40]
	set the contrast. 0 is maximum contrast and 40 minimum

    usblcd led [led number] [0|1]
	turn on/off one of the front panel leds (1-8)

    usblcd clear
	clears LCD screen
	
    usblcd text [row:0-1][column:0-19][text]
	prints text on LCD screen starting with row and column
	
    usblcd splash [filename]
	sets the splash screens content from filename.
	Samples of splash files are located in doc/ directory.
	After the splash file has been loaded into EEPROM the usb
	lcd should be restarted by reconnecting it to USB port.
	
	Example of a splash file:
	
	# Splash file must have :splash as header.
	# Current compiled version support 2 lines of 20 characters each
        # Number of lines/columns can be changed in driver.h
	#
	# Format is:

     write the firmware from filename into EEPROM
     
    usblcd read
	read events (key press and infrared data) and outputs to stderr
	This data can be piped and parsed by another application.
	Format is: KEY: <key1> <key2> 
		   IR:  <IR1> ... <IRn>
		   
	For keyboard events <00> <00> means key release or more than 2
	keys pressed at the same time.

Examples 
--------
 usblcd led 1 1 wait 1 led 2 1 wait 1 backlight 1 contrast 0 text 1 2 "mini-box.com USB LCD" read
 
This will lightup first led then wait 1 second, light the second
led and wait 1 second, will turn backlight on, set the contrast 
to maximum, write the "mini-box.com USB LCD" text to second row
starting from third column, and will continue printing events
till closed with CTRL+C or SIGTERM
